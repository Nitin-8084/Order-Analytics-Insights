Project Overview
This project analyses order data to generate insights based on customer demographics and meal preferences. The dashboard includes key visualizations and metrics to assist in understanding order trends by age group and meal type.

Features
Order Count by Age Group and Meal Type: Visualizes the distribution of orders segmented by customer age groups and meal types.
Overall Trends: Provides an overview of sales and order data to highlight patterns.
Interactive Filters: Allows users to explore specific age groups, meal types, or time periods.

 Tools and Technologies
 Excel: Data cleaning, aggregation, and initial analysis.
 Power BI/Tableau: Dashboard creation and interactive visualizations.
 MySQL: Data querying and advanced transformations (if applicable).

 Dataset Description
The dataset contains:
 Order ID: Unique identifier for each order.
 Age Group: Segmented customer age groups.
 Meal Type: Type of meal ordered (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner).
 Additional fields for further insights (e.g., sales, region, time).

 Steps to Recreate the Dashboard
1. Data Preparation:
    Clean the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent values.
    Aggregate data based on required dimensions and metrics.

2. Data Analysis:
    Analyze order trends using Excel and MySQL queries.
    Identify key insights to feature in the dashboard.

3. Visualization:
    Use Power BI or Tableau to create interactive visualizations.
    Add slicers/filters for dynamic exploration.

 Insights Derived
 Popular meal types among different age groups.
 Order frequency patterns by age and meal categories.
 Usage
1. Open the dashboard file in Power BI.
2. Use filters to explore specific subsets of data.
3. Review the visualizations for actionable insights.
